Thanks for the full context — that helps a lot. Given your manager's instructions, here’s how we’ll approach this step-by-step so you can check off linting and build toward testing, docs, and metadata automation.

✅ Step 1: Final lint.yml Workflow (Ready to Use)
Here's a cleaned-up, functioning version of your lint.yml that:

Works on any repo (even if it’s just started)

Includes pylint and pycodestyle (PEP8)

Uploads report artifacts

Doesn’t block the CI (yet)

📝 Instruction Sheet (for SharePoint or Internal Docs)
Here’s a short, user-friendly document you can include in SharePoint to explain this file:

📄 GitHub Actions Linting Setup (PEP8 + pylint)
Purpose:
Automatically check all Python files for code quality and style issues on every push or pull request to the main branch.

🔧 What It Does
Installs pylint and pycodestyle (PEP8 style checker).

Finds all Python files in the repo.

Runs both linters and uploads the results as downloadable reports.

📁 File Location
.github/workflows/lint.yml

✅ Setup Steps
Copy the provided lint.yml into your repo under .github/workflows/.

Push to the main branch.

Check the Actions tab on GitHub to see results.

🔍 View Reports
Go to Actions.

Click on a workflow run.

Scroll to Artifacts at the bottom to download reports:

pylint.report.txt

pycodestyle.report.txt

🔄 Customization
To lint only specific folders, update find . -name "*.py" to something like find src/ -name "*.py".

To make CI fail on lint errors, remove --exit-zero and || true.
